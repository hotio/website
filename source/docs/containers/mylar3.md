## Starting the container

Just the basics to get the container running:

```shell hl_lines="4 5 6 7 8 9"
docker run --rm \
    --name mylar3 \
    -p 8090:8090 \
    -e PUID=1000 \
    -e PGID=1000 \
    -e UMASK=002 \
    -e TZ="Etc/UTC" \
    -e ARGS="" \
    -e DEBUG="no" \
    -v /<host_folder_config>:/config \
    hotio/mylar3
```

The [highlighted](https://hotio.dev/containers/mylar3) variables are all optional, the values you see are the defaults. In most cases you'll need to add an additional volume (`-v`) or more, depending on your own personal preference, to get access to additional files.

## Tags

| Tag                | Upstream                           |
| -------------------|------------------------------------|
| `release` (latest) | GitHub releases                    |
| `nightly`          | Every commit to python3-dev branch |

You can also find tags that reference a commit or version number.

## Configuration location

Your mylar3 configuration inside the container is stored in `/config/app`, to migrate from another container, you'd probably have to move your files from `/config` to `/config/app`.

## Executing your own scripts

If you have a need to do additional stuff when the container starts or stops, you can mount your script with `-v /docker/host/my-script.sh:/etc/cont-init.d/99-my-script` to execute your script on container start or `-v /docker/host/my-script.sh:/etc/cont-finish.d/99-my-script` to execute it when the container stops. An example script can be seen below.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash

echo "Hello, this is me, your script."
```

## Troubleshooting a problem

By default all output is redirected to `/dev/null`, so you won't see anything from the application when using `docker logs`. Most applications write everything to a log file too. If you do want to see this output with `docker logs`, you can use `-e DEBUG="yes"` to enable this.
