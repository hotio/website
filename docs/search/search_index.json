If you want to get the local ip from a network interface, use something like local:eth0 as DETECTION_MODE . The following environment variables are used to configure the domains you would like to update. -e CF_USER = \"your.cf.email@example.com\" -e CF_APIKEY = \"your.global.apikey\" -e CF_APITOKEN = \"\" -e CF_APITOKEN_ZONE = \"\" -e CF_HOSTS = \"test.example.com;test.foobar.com;test2.foobar.com\" -e CF_ZONES = \"example.com;foobar.com;foobar.com\" -e CF_RECORDTYPES = \"A;A;AAAA\" Notice that we give 3 values each time for CF_HOSTS , CF_ZONES and CF_RECORDTYPES . In our example, the domain test.foobar.com belonging to the zone foobar.com will have its A record updated with an ipv4 ip. If you use CF_APITOKEN , you can leave CF_USER and CF_APIKEY empty. IMPORTANT: All the domain names in CF_HOSTS should have properly configured DNS records on Cloudflare, they will not be created. Tags Tag Description release (latest) The main branch You can also find tags that reference a commit or version number. Zone ID Instead of the zone_name , you can also fill in a zone_id in CF_ZONES . When using a zone_id , you can use a scoped token ( CF_APITOKEN ) that only needs the Zone - DNS - Edit permissions. This improves security. The configuration could look like the example below. -e CF_APITOKEN = \"azkqvJ86wEScojvSJC8DyY67TwqNwZCtomEVrHwt\" -e CF_HOSTS = \"example.com;test.foobar.com\" -e CF_ZONES = \"zbpsi9ceikrdnnym27s2xnp6s5dvj6ep;dccbe6grakumohwwd4amh4o46yupepn8\" -e CF_RECORDTYPES = \"A;A\" Seperate API Tokens If you do not prefer to use a zone_id , but prefer some more security, you can use 2 seperate tokens. CF_APITOKEN configured with: Permissions Zone - DNS - Edit Zone Resources Include - Specific zone - example.com Include - Specific zone - foobar.com CF_APITOKEN_ZONE configured with: Permissions Zone - Zone - Read Zone Resources Include - All zones Leaving CF_APITOKEN_ZONE blank would mean that only CF_APITOKEN will be used and thus that token should have all required permissions. Which usually means that the token could edit all zones or not be able to fetch the zone_id from the zone_name . Configuration combination examples Below are some example configuration combinations, ordered from most secure to least secure.

Use this if you always wanna see what's going on, but 3 gives you too much output. UPDATE, WARNING, ERROR, INFO 3 will give you the following output types. This is the default. UPDATE, WARNING, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG JSON log Every IP update is also logged to /config/app/cf-ddns-updates.json . This can be used with the Telegraf JSON parser and the tail input, to get your domain updates into InfluxDB.

This means minimal api calls to Cloudflare. If you have made any manual changes to the IP on the Cloudflare webinterface, for instance when wanting to test an update, a container restart is needed to clear the cache. The proxy setting (orange cloud) and TTL is also cached and re-set based on the previous value, so if you made any modifications to these settings, you should restart the container so that the script is aware of the new settings. Sending notifications using Apprise You can send notifications when a DNS record gets updated with a new IP using Apprise .
