When joining the Discord server you'll get access to the #image-builds channel and you can keep an eye on when your favorite app has released a new update. All the updating of docker images is automated, giving you the fastest updates. We're not just building them and pushing them out though...no, every app is tested and when they fail the test, pushing to the registries is cancelled. This for the most part ensures your system remains operational when you are doing auto-updates and are not paying attention. The images get pushed to DockerHub and ghcr.io . They can then be pulled from DockerHub with docker pull hotio/... and from ghcr.io with docker pull ghcr.io/hotio/... . On this website you'll also find all the documentation needed to get the containers running. All commands provided include the most basic to get the container running. In most cases you'll have to add additional volumes to get access to your other files that every app needs. Almost all the commands will start with docker run -rm ... , which is the same as docker create , followed by docker start . The argument --rm will make sure that when we exit the container, it'll get deleted. As you might have guessed, these command are not suited for longterm use. For that we suggest to maybe use compose or integrate the commands with systemd . Images where you see a mention of ENTRYPOINT are meant to be used like any other cli app, except that they are containerized. If you like what I do, you know the drill...

If you want to get the local ip from a network interface, use something like local:eth0 as DETECTION_MODE . Notice that we give 3 values each time for CF_HOSTS , CF_ZONES and CF_RECORDTYPES . In our example, the domain test.foobar.com belonging to the zone foobar.com will have its A record updated with an ipv4 ip. If you use CF_APITOKEN , you can leave CF_USER and CF_APIKEY empty. IMPORTANT: All the domain names in CF_HOSTS should have properly configured DNS records on Cloudflare, they will not be created. Tags Tag Description release (latest) The main branch You can also find tags that reference a commit or version number. Zone ID Instead of the zone_name , you can also fill in a zone_id in CF_ZONES . When using a zone_id , you can use a scoped token ( CF_APITOKEN ) that only needs the Zone - DNS - Edit permissions. This improves security. The configuration could look like the example below. -e CF_APITOKEN = \"azkqvJ86wEScojvSJC8DyY67TwqNwZCtomEVrHwt\" -e CF_HOSTS = \"example.com;test.foobar.com\" -e CF_ZONES = \"zbpsi9ceikrdnnym27s2xnp6s5dvj6ep;dccbe6grakumohwwd4amh4o46yupepn8\" -e CF_RECORDTYPES = \"A;A\" Seperate API Tokens If you do not prefer to use a zone_id , but prefer some more security, you can use 2 seperate tokens. CF_APITOKEN configured with: Permissions Zone - DNS - Edit Zone Resources Include - Specific zone - example.com Include - Specific zone - foobar.com CF_APITOKEN_ZONE configured with: Permissions Zone - Zone - Read Zone Resources Include - All zones Leaving CF_APITOKEN_ZONE blank would mean that only CF_APITOKEN will be used and thus that token should have all required permissions. Which usually means that the token could edit all zones or not be able to fetch the zone_id from the zone_name . Configuration combination examples Below are some example configuration combinations, ordered from most secure to least secure.

Log levels For LOG_LEVEL you can pick 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 . 0 will give no log output. It's not recommended to use. 1 will give you the following output types. It's the recommended value when all things are configured and running as expected. UPDATE, WARNING, ERROR 2 will give you the following output types. Use this if you always wanna see what's going on, but 3 gives you too much output. UPDATE, WARNING, ERROR, INFO 3 will give you the following output types. This is the default. UPDATE, WARNING, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG JSON log Every IP update is also logged to /config/app/cf-ddns-updates.json . This can be used with the Telegraf JSON parser and the tail input, to get your domain updates into InfluxDB. Example output below. { \"domain\" : \"vpn.example.com\" , \"recordtype\" : \"A\" , \"ip\" : \"1.1.1.1\" , \"timestamp\" : \"2020-05-17T20:27:14Z\" } { \"domain\" : \"vpn.example.com\" , \"recordtype\" : \"A\" , \"ip\" : \"1.1.1.1\" , \"timestamp\" : \"2020-05-17T20:29:26Z\" } Cached results from Cloudflare The returned results from Cloudflare are cached. This means minimal api calls to Cloudflare. If you have made any manual changes to the IP on the Cloudflare webinterface, for instance when wanting to test an update, a container restart is needed to clear the cache. The proxy setting (orange cloud) and TTL is also cached and re-set based on the previous value, so if you made any modifications to these settings, you should restart the container so that the script is aware of the new settings. Sending notifications using cloudflare-ddns You can send notifications when a DNS record gets updated with a new IP using cloudflare-ddns . Use the environment variable cloudflare-ddns to configure notifications, see below for some examples. -e cloudflare-ddns = \"pover://user@token\" -e cloudflare-ddns = \"pover://user@token;discord://webhook_id/webhook_token\"","title":"hotio/cloudflare-ddns"},{"location":"containers/cloudflare-ddns/#starting-the-container","text":"Just the basics to get the container running: docker run --rm \\ --name cloudflare-ddns \\ -e PUID = 1000 \\ -e PGID = 1000 \\ -e UMASK = 002 \\ -e TZ = \"Etc/UTC\" \\ -e ARGS = \"\" \\ -e INTERVAL = 300 \\ -e DETECTION_MODE = \"dig-whoami.cloudflare\" \\ -e LOG_LEVEL = 3 \\ -e cloudflare-ddns = \"\" \\ -e CF_USER = \"your.cf.email@example.com\" \\ -e CF_APIKEY = \"your.global.apikey\" \\ -e CF_APITOKEN = \"\" \\ -e CF_APITOKEN_ZONE = \"\" \\ -e CF_HOSTS = \"test.example.com;test.foobar.com;test2.foobar.com\" \\ -e CF_ZONES = \"example.com;foobar.com;foobar.com\" \\ -e CF_RECORDTYPES = \"A;A;AAAA\" \\ -v /<host_folder_config>:/config \\ hotio/cloudflare-ddns The highlighted variables are all optional, the values you see are the defaults.
