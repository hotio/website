!!! warning "Don't be stupid!"

    People don't be stupid like this guy from [apogliaghi.com](https://apogliaghi.com/2025/09/crypto-miner-in-hotio/qbittorrent)! I'm not bundling a cryptominer. If you want to play sysadmin, know what you are doing! It's fairly well known that if you expose qBittorrent (or other software) to the world, that there's a chance you're gonna get pwned. Certainly if you keep running old versions (I'm not gonna bother checking how old his digest sha actually is). All sourcecode is visible on GitHub and verifiable by anyone. The screenshotted oneliner from discord without any context can also be searched for in my discord server if you wanna read the context. The sad part here is that the incompetent person throwing false accusations around is probably seen by his family as the smart nephew that knows everything about computers. RIP The Family! See this article on [torrentfreak.com](https://torrentfreak.com/qbittorrent-web-ui-exploited-to-mine-cryptocurrency-heres-how-to-fix-230902/) for more info on how you could get pwned. He's not the first one and sadly he's not going to be the last victim, but atleast man up and own your mistake!

## Starting the container

=== "cli"

    ```shell linenums="1"
    docker run --rm \
        --name qbittorrent \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        -e PUID=1000 \
        -e PGID=1000 \
        -e UMASK=002 \
        -e TZ="Etc/UTC" \
        -e WEBUI_PORTS="8080/tcp,8080/udp" \
        -e LIBTORRENT="v1" \
        -v /<host_folder_config>:/config \
        -v /<host_folder_data>:/data \
        ghcr.io/hotio/qbittorrent
